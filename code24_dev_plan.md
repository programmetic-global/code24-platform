## Development Philosophy

### Working with Claude Code

**Daily Development Flow:**
1. Start Claude Code session in terminal
2. Describe feature/task in natural language
3. Claude Code writes code, runs tests
4. Review, iterate, commit
5. Deploy to staging/production

**Claude Code Advantages:**
- Writes complete features from description
- Follows project structure automatically
- Implements error handling
- Writes tests alongside code
- Suggests optimizations
- Maintains consistency

**Example Claude Code Prompt:**
```bash
# In terminal with Claude Code
"Create a React component for the AI Workers monitor dashboard.
It should show 5 workers in real-time, with live status,
current activity, and stats. Use Tailwind for styling,
fetch data from /api/workers endpoint, update every 10 seconds.
Include loading and error states."
```

### Workers for Platforms Structure

```javascript
// Each customer gets their own Worker namespace
// Namespace per customer: build-customer-{id} or optimize-customer-{id}

export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const customerId = env.CUSTOMER_ID;
    
    // Serve generated HTML/CSS/JS
    if (url.pathname.endsWith('.html') || url.pathname === '/') {
      const html = await env.R2.get(`${customerId}/site.html`);
      
      // Apply active optimizations
      const optimizations = await getOptimizations(customerId, env);
      const optimizedHTML = applyOptimizations(html, optimizations);
      
      // Inject analytics
      const finalHTML = injectAnalytics(optimizedHTML, customerId);
      
      return new Response(finalHTML, {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }

    }
    
    // Handle form submissions
    if (request.method === 'POST' && url.pathname === '/api/form') {
      return handleFormSubmission(request, customerId, env);
    }
  }
}

    // Get optimizations from main platform
    const optimizations = await fetch(
      `https://api.code24.dev/optimizations/${customerId}`
    ).then(r => r.json());
    
    // Apply optimizations

## Development Workflow with Claude Code

### Daily Development Routine

```bash
# Morning: Start Claude Code session
cd code24-platform
claude-code

# Example interaction:
You: "Today I need to build the AI worker monitoring dashboard.
     It should show 5 workers with real-time status,
     current activity, and today's stats.
     Use the existing dashboard layout and Tailwind styling."

Claude Code: [Analyzes codebase, creates components,
              implements WebSocket connection, writes tests,
              shows preview]

You: "Looks good, but make the worker cards larger and
     add a pulse animation when workers are active."

Claude Code: [Updates styling, adds animation, refreshes preview]

You: "Perfect, commit this."

Claude Code: [Writes commit message, commits code]

# Afternoon: Continue with next feature
You: "Now implement the form submission manager.
     Users should see a list of submissions like an inbox..."

# Continue throughout day with iterative development
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
```typescript
// Test all utility functions, hooks, API functions
// Example: src/lib/optimization.test.ts

import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { applyOptimization, scoreImpact } from './optimization';

describe('Optimization Engine', () => {
  it('applies SEO optimization correctly', () => {
    const html = '<head></head>';
    const result = applyOptimization(html, {
      type: 'seo',
      meta_description: 'Test description'
    });
    expect(result).toContain('meta name="description"');
  });
  
  it('scores impact correctly', () => {
    const score = scoreImpact('performance', { improvement: 50 });
    expect(score).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
// Test API endpoints
// Example: tests/api/projects.test.ts

import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { testClient } from './setup';

describe('Projects API', () => {
  it('creates new build project', async () => {
    const response = await testClient.post('/api/projects', {
      type: 'build',
      name: 'Test Project'
    });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.id).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
```typescript
// Test critical user flows
// Example: tests/e2e/build-project.spec.ts

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('user can create and deploy build project', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password');

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments

**Development:**
- Local: `localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
- Workers: `wrangler dev` (local Workers)
- Database: Local D1 database

**Staging:**

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Workers for Platforms complexity | High | Start simple, iterate, extensive testing |
| AI generation quality | High | Human review loop, templates, feedback system |
| Scale issues at 1000+ sites | Medium | Load testing, optimization, caching |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Regular audits, penetration testing, bug bounty |
| Third-party API failures | Medium | Fallbacks, retries, error handling |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Slow customer acquisition | High | Product Hunt launch, content marketing, referrals |
| High churn rate | High | Excellent onboarding, constant value delivery |
| Competition | Medium | First-mover advantage, continuous innovation |
| Pricing too low/high | Medium | A/B test pricing, customer feedback |

## Next Steps

### Week 1: Immediate Actions

1. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   brew install node pnpm
   npm install -g wrangler
   
   # Create project
   pnpm create vite code24-dashboard --template react-ts
   cd code24-dashboard
   pnpm install
   
   # Add Tailwind
   pnpm add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   pnpm tailwindcss init -p
   
   # Initialize Cloudflare Workers
   wrangler init code24-api
   ```

2. **Set up Claude Code**
   ```bash
   # Start Claude Code in your project
   cd code24-dashboard
   claude-code
   
   # First prompt:
   "Help me set up this project structure for Code24.dev.
   It's a SaaS platform for AI-powered websites.
   I need: authentication, dashboard, API structure,
   and Cloudflare Workers integration."
   ```

3. **Create initial database schema**
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create code24-dev
   wrangler d1 execute code24-dev --file=schema.sql
   ```

4. **Start building Phase 1, Month 1 features**

### Week 2-4: Build momentum
- Complete authentication system
- Build project creation flow
- Deploy first working prototype
- Invite first beta testers

## Conclusion

This project plan provides a complete roadmap to build Code24.dev using Claude Code as your AI pair programmer. The phased approach allows for:

- **Rapid iteration:** Claude Code speeds up development 5-10x
- **Quality code:** Built-in testing, error handling, best practices
- **Scalable architecture:** Cloudflare's edge platform handles growth
- **Manageable scope:** Clear milestones every month

**Key to Success:**
1. **Start small:** MVP in 3 months with core features
2. **Learn fast:** Beta testers provide critical feedback
3. **Iterate quickly:** Claude Code enables fast changes
4. **Scale intelligently:** Add features based on user needs
5. **Stay focused:** Build what matters, skip what doesn't

**With Claude Code + this plan, Code24.dev can go from idea to production in 12 months, with an MVP in just 3 months.**
