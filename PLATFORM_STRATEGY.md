# Code24 Platform Strategy: Optimize-First Approach

## üéØ Strategic Decision: Why Optimize-First?

### **The Market Reality**
- **200M+ existing websites globally** vs. much smaller new website market
- **99.9% of websites are "dead"** - never improve after initial launch
- **Massive underperformance** - most sites getting 1-3% conversion rates
- **Perfect timing** - businesses increasingly need digital optimization

### **Customer Psychology**
- **Lower Risk**: Enhancing existing investment vs. rebuilding from scratch
- **Immediate Value**: Can show before/after improvements on real sites
- **Universal Need**: Every business with a website can benefit
- **Less Commitment**: Easier decision than complete website rebuild

### **Competitive Differentiation**
