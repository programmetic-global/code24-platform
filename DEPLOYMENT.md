# Deployment Guide

## Infrastructure Setup

This platform uses advanced infrastructure for competitive advantage. Key components:

### 1. Core Platform
- **Main worker**: Handles customer site generation and API
- **Customer dispatcher**: Routes subdomain traffic to isolated workers  
- **Database cluster**: Goal-based analytics with multi-tenant architecture
- **Storage layer**: Asset management and site hosting

### 2. Customer Isolation
- Each customer gets isolated compute environment
- Subdomain-based routing (customer.code24.dev)
- Independent analytics and optimization cycles
- Scalable dispatch architecture

### 3. Goal-Based Analytics
- Business-type aware metrics (ecommerce, lead_gen, saas, service)
- Conversion tracking by primary goals (sales, leads, signups, bookings, traffic)
- Real-time visitor/session management
- A/B testing framework for continuous optimization

## Setup Requirements

1. **Account Setup**
   - Enterprise-grade infrastructure account
   - Domain management access  
   - SSL certificate automation

2. **Database Initialization**
   ```bash
   # Initialize core schema
   npm run db:setup
   
   # Seed with sample data
   npm run db:seed
   ```

3. **Worker Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Deploy main platform
   npm run deploy:platform
   
   # Deploy customer templates
   npm run deploy:customers
   
   # Set up routing
   npm run setup:routing
   ```

4. **Domain Configuration**
   - DNS routing for main domain
   - Wildcard subdomain configuration
   - SSL certificate deployment
   - CDN optimization

## Scaling Architecture

The platform is designed for:
- **100+ customer sites** per worker instance
- **Real-time analytics** processing
- **AI-powered optimization** cycles
- **Enterprise SLA** compliance

Future worker additions will extend:
- Advanced AI features
- Industry-specific optimizations  
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced analytics processing
