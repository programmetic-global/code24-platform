    'template_access', 
    'brand_kit_application',
    'export_management',
    'collaboration_features'
  ]
}
```

### 🎯 **Design Worker Integration**
```typescript
class RealCanvaMCPIntegration {
  async createDesign(request: MCPDesignRequest) {
    // Use real Claude Canva connector
    const canvaResponse = await this.callClaudeCanvaConnector({
      action: 'create_design',
      template: this.selectOptimalTemplate(request),
      brandKit: request.brandGuidelines,
      content: request.content,
      dimensions: request.dimensions
    });
    
    return this.processCanvaResponse(canvaResponse);
  }
  
  private async callClaudeCanvaConnector(params: any) {
    // Integration with real Claude Canva MCP connector
    // This would use the authenticated Canva connection
    return await claudeCanvaConnector.execute(params);
  }
}
```
