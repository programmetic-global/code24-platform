## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhance Optimize (4 weeks)
1. **Add PRD features** to existing workers:
   - GEO optimization in SEO worker
   - Psychology tactics in Conversion worker  
   - Cross-site learning analytics
   - Next-gen performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Add Build Capability (4 weeks)
1. **Leverage existing workers** for site generation
2. **Create minimal new workers**:
   - Site Generator (uses existing AI Content + Performance)
   - Design Adapter (uses optimization data)
3. **Automatic backend generation**

### Phase 3: Unify Intelligence (4 weeks)  
1. **Shared learning system**
2. **Cross-product insights**
3. **Network effect optimization**

## Key Advantages

✅ **Leverage existing work** - Don't rebuild optimization workers  
✅ **Network effects** - Build benefits from Optimize data  
✅ **Faster MVP** - Build uses proven optimization patterns  
✅ **Unified platform** - Single codebase, shared intelligence  
✅ **Market coverage** - New sites + existing sites  
✅ **Competitive moat** - Cross-site learning is unique  

## Revenue Model

**Code24 Optimize:** $97-297/month per site  
**Code24 Build:** $497-997 one-time + optimization subscription  
**Shared Intelligence:** Both products improve together
