# 🕐 Code24 Platform Cron Triggers Implementation

## ✅ **Successfully Implemented Scheduled Tasks**

### **1. Development Environment (dev)**
```
Trigger: "0 * * * *" (Every hour)
Function: runHourlyDevelopmentTasks()
```
**Purpose**: Hourly health checks and development monitoring
- Elite Workers health verification (3/3 workers)
- R2 Storage connectivity tests
- Customer workers status monitoring
- Development metrics collection
- Light optimization testing

### **2. Production Environment (staging/production)**
```
Triggers: 
- "*/3 * * * *" (Every 3 minutes)
- "0 15 1 * *" (15:00 UTC on 1st of month)
- "59 23 LW * *" (23:59 UTC on last weekday)
```

#### **🔄 Continuous Optimization (Every 3 minutes)**
**Function**: `runContinuousOptimization()`
- Scans all active customer sites
- Triggers Elite Workers analysis (Brand, Design, Developer)
- Stores optimization results in R2 storage
- Ensures 24/7 continuous improvement

#### **📊 Monthly Analytics (1st of month, 15:00 UTC)**
**Function**: `runMonthlyAnalytics()`
- Aggregates customer metrics for the month
- Calculates platform-wide performance data
- Generates monthly analytics reports
- Updates platform analytics engine
- Stores comprehensive data in R2

#### **📋 End-of-Month Reporting (Last weekday, 23:59 UTC)**
**Function**: `runEndOfMonthReporting()`
- Generates comprehensive end-of-month reports
- Calculates revenue metrics (MRR, churn, expansion)
- Technical performance analysis
- Executive summary generation
- Stakeholder reporting preparation
