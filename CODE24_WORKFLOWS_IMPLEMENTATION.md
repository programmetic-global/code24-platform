## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Workflow Coordination**
```typescript
export class BuildWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, BuildWorkflowParams> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<BuildWorkflowParams>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    // Step 1: Market Intelligence Phase
    const marketIntelligence = await step.do('market-intelligence', async () => {
      // Coordinated market research and competitive analysis
    });
    
    // Step 2: Elite Workers Phase (Enhanced with Market Intelligence)  
    const eliteResults = await step.do('elite-workers', async () => {
      // Sequential brand → design → development with market context
    });
    
    // Step 3: Site Generation and Deployment
    const deployment = await step.do('deployment', async () => {
      // Enhanced site creation with strategic positioning
    });
    
    // Step 4: Analytics and Monitoring Setup
    await step.do('analytics-setup', async () => {
      // Performance tracking with competitive benchmarks
    });
  }
}
```

### **Retry Logic and Fault Tolerance**
- **Market Intelligence**: 3 retries, 5s delay, exponential backoff, 2min timeout
- **Elite Workers**: 3 retries, 10s delay, exponential backoff, 5-8min timeout
- **Coordination Delays**: 30s between workers to prevent overwhelming
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and reporting

### **Worker Coordination**
